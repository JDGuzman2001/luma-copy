# Luma Copy

I have developed a replica of the Luma interface using a combination of modern technologies such as React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and the TicketMaster API. This project not only represents significant effort but also showcases the technical skills acquired through various courses and development experiences.

# Technologies Used
#  1. React:

- Used as the primary framework for building the user interface.
- Enables the creation of reusable components and a modular architecture, facilitating application maintenance and scalability.
#  2. Vite:

- Fast and efficient build tool.
- Enhances the development experience with minimal configuration and very fast hot reload times.

#  3. Tailwind CSS:

- CSS framework that provides low-level utilities for building custom designs.
- Facilitates the creation of an elegant and responsive user interface without writing extensive CSS from scratch.

#  4. Firebase:

- Used for user authentication and real-time data storage.
- Provides seamless and secure integration to manage users and data, streamlining the development of login functionality.

#  5. TicketMaster API:

- Implemented to fetch and display upcoming events in Houston, USA.
- Allows users to view events occurring in the next seven days, providing updated and relevant information.

# Application Features

#  1. Home Page:

- Presents an attractive design with a prominent "Sign In" button.
- Acts as the gateway for users wishing to access the application.

#  2. Sign In Page:

- Developed using Firebase Authentication to securely handle user login.
- The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth user experience.

#  3. Events Page:

- Utilizes the TicketMaster API to fetch and display upcoming events in Houston.
- Events are presented clearly and organized, allowing users to easily explore available options.
This project has been an excellent opportunity to consolidate my knowledge and skills in modern web development, using a powerful and industry-relevant technological stack.
